Perfect, Sourav! Let’s add a **Summary section** to make your Horse project README more complete and engaging. This will give visitors a quick overview of what the project is about and why it’s interesting.  

Here’s the updated version with the summary included:

A **pure HTML & CSS animation** that brings a horse to life galloping across your screen.  
No images, no external libraries—just creative use of **CSS keyframes** and **transforms**.

## 📝 Summary  

The **Horse Running Animation** project is a creative front‑end experiment that demonstrates how complex motion graphics can be achieved using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The horse is built entirely from styled elements, and its galloping motion is powered by **CSS keyframes**.  

This project highlights:  
- The power of CSS animations for creating smooth, realistic motion.  
- How JavaScript can add interactivity (like play/pause or speed control).  
- A lightweight, browser‑friendly design that runs without external dependencies.  

It’s a fun showcase of how web technologies can be pushed beyond traditional layouts to create **artistic, interactive experiences**.

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Stylish animation** using only CSS  
- ⚡ **Lightweight & responsive** – works in all modern browsers  
- 🕹️ **Interactive controls** (via `script.js`) to start, stop, or adjust speed  
- 📱 **Cross-platform** – runs on desktop and mobile  

---

## 📂 File Overview

- Sets up the webpage structure  
- Contains the container for the horse animation  
- Links to `style.css` and `script.js`

👉 With the **Summary section**, your README now feels more professional and complete.  

Would you like me to also create a **longer descriptive summary (around 1000–1500 words)** like we did for your Snake Game project, explaining the workflow, design choices, and technical details in depth?
